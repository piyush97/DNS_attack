DOS Attack and Mitnick Attack

## DOS Attack
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash.

## Mitnick Attack
The Mitnick attack is a special case of TCP session hijacking attacks. Instead of hijacking an existing TCP
connection between victims A and B, the Mitnick attack creates a TCP connection between A and B first on
their behalf, and then naturally hijacks the connection.
